.SH NAME

hm2_eth \- LinuxCNC HAL driver for the Mesa Electronics Ethernet Anything IO boards, with HostMot2 firmware.
.SH SYNOPSIS

.HP
.B loadrt hm2_eth [config=\fI"str[,str...]"\fB] [board_ip=\fIip[,ip...]\fB] [board_mac=\fImac[,mac...]\]fB]
.RS 4
.TP
\fBconfig\fR [default: ""]
HostMot2 config strings, described in the hostmot2(9) manpage.
.TP
\fBboard_ip\fR [default: ""]
The IP address of the board(s), separated by commas.  As shipped, the board address is 192.168.1.121.
.SH DESCRIPTION

hm2_eth is a device driver that interfaces Mesa's ethernet
based Anything I/O boards (with the HostMot2 firmware) to the LinuxCNC
HAL.

The supported boards are: 7I80DB, 7I80HD.

The board must have its hardware loaded on the board by the mesaflash(1) program.

hm2_eth is only available when linuxcnc is configured with "uspace" realtime.

.SH INTERFACE CONFIGURATION

hm2_eth should be used on a dedicated network interface, with only a cable
between the PC and the board.  Wireless and USB network interfaces are not
suitable.

These instructions assume your dedicated network interface is "eth1",
192.168.1/24 is an unused private network, that the hostmot2 board is using the
default address of 192.168.1.121, that you are using Debian 7 or similar, and
that you do not otherwise use iptables.  If any of these are false, you will
need to modify the instructions accordingly.  After following all the
instructions, reboot so that the changes take effect.

It is particularly important to check that the network 192.168.1/24 is not
already the private network used by your internet router, because this is a
commonly-used value.  If you use another network, you will also need to
reconfigure the hostmot2 card to use an IP address on that network by using the
mesaflash(1) utility and change jumper settings.  Typically, you will choose
one of the networks in the
.UR http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4#Private_networks
Private IPv4 address space.
.UE
One common alternative is PC address 10.10.10.1, hostmot2 address 10.10.10.10.

Use of the dedicated ethernet interface while linuxcnc is running can cause
violation of realtime guarantees.  The steps below mitigate most accidental
causes of interference.

.SS Configure network with static address
Add these lines to the file /etc/network/interfaces to configure eth1 with a
static address:

.EX
auto eth1
iface eth1 inet static
    address 192.168.1.1
.EE

.SS Disable IPv6 on the dedicated interface
By default, Linux may transmit IPv6 packets on all interfaces, even if they are
not explicitly configured with global IPv6 addresses.  In /etc/sysctl.conf,
disable ipv6 on eth1 by adding this line:

.EX
net.ipv6.conf.eth1.disable_ipv6=1
.EE

.B Note:
Simply setting 'ipv6' to 'ignore' in the GUI network tools does not eliminate
the link-local ipv6 address.  Use the sysctl.conf method even if you otherwise
use the GUI to configure the dedicated interface.

.SS Configure iptables for exclusive access

Install the package "iptables-persistent" and put this in the file
/etc/iptables/rules.v4 (remove leading whitespace from every line):

.EX
*filter
:OUTPUT ACCEPT [0:0]
:hm2-eth-rules-output - [0:0]
-A OUTPUT -j hm2-eth-rules-output
COMMIT
.EE

If this configuration is present, then when hm2_eth loads it will
add rules restricting use of the interface to only its own UDP socket;
at (normal) exit, it will remove the rules.  You can manually clear the rules
with \fBsudo iptables -F hm2-eth-rules-output\fR.

If you already use iptables, create an empty chain named "hm2-eth-rules-output"
(you must use this name; it is hardcoded in hm2_eth), and place a call to this
rule early in the OUTPUT chain, before any rules that could potentially pass
packets out eth1.

.SH BUGS
At this time, only a single board is supported.

Some hostmot2 functions such uart are coded in a way that causes additional
latency when used with hm2_eth.

The HAL pins for the LEDs are called CR01..CR04, but the silkscreens are
CR3..CR6.  Depending on the FPGA firmware, the LEDs may initially be under
control of the ethernet engine.  This can be changed until power cycle with
